# 3.3 Hyperparameter Tuning

The test performance of models is often sensitive to the choice of parameters and the model's capacity. However, it can be difficult to tell what are the best parameters to use.

**Hyperparameter tuning** is the process of finding the best parameters for a model. This is done by searching over a range of values for each parameter and evaluating the model's performance on a validation set. The parameters that give the best performance are then used to train the final model. A hyperparameter's value is chosen rather than learnt from the data. The process of finding the best hyperparameter values is called **hyperparameter search**.

More information about hyperparameter tuning can be found in the [Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1479).
