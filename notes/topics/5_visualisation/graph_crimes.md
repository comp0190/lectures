## Example 1

What's wrong with this graph?

![example 1](https://i.imgur.com/u16vTqy.png)

```{admonition} Suggested reasons
:class: dropdown
* The **x-axis does not start at zero**, so it greatly exaggerates the difference between countries.
* We are **not given any uncertainties**, so we cannot tell how confident we should be in the differences between countries.
```

## Example 2

What's wrong with this graph?

![example 2](https://i.imgur.com/eHM3JzA.png)

```{admonition} Suggested reasons
:class: dropdown
* The **x-axis scale suddenly changes** from linear to logarithmic. This creates the impression that growth among the top income brackets is spread across a much wider range than it actually is. We should actually see more of a sharp increase for a very small fraction of the population.
* The **grid lines** add to this impression, as they are spaced out in a way that makes the scale is uniformly spaced.
```

## Example 3

What's wrong with this figure?

![example 3](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fl_XcNlXgAE9PQ4?format=jpg&name=medium)
```{admonition} Suggested reasons
:class: dropdown
* The **scale** of the humans is misleading.
```

## Example 4

What's wrong with this figure?

![example 4](https://i.imgur.com/adT9Snr.jpg)
```{admonition} Suggested reasons
:class: dropdown
* There is **too much information**. It is difficult to understand the main points the figure is aiming to convey.
```

## Example 5

What's wrong with this figure?

![example 5](https://www.callingbullshit.org/tools/img/nothing_on_the_axis.jpg)
```{admonition} Suggested reasons
:class: dropdown
* The use of a line graph is **misleading**. The data is actually categorical, so a bar chart would be more appropriate.
* The **y-axis is not labelled**. We can't tell immediately what the axes are.
* The **x-axis is confusing**. There is too much precision in the numbers, and they should not be evenly spaced.
* The font is **hard to read**.
