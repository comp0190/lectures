There are several methods one can use to do validation such as k-fold cross validation and hold out validation. These methods are pre-packaged in libraries such as Scikit-learn.

    "Bayesian Optimisation introduces the Surrogate Function to repsent how the hyperparameters affect performance. In this case, the Surrogate Function is a calculated regression model that is supposed to approximate the real relationship between hypeparameter values and the loss.\n",

    "#### Caution\n",
    "Sounds like an extremely effective approach in itself, although one must take into account that this procedure also results in additional computational effort and that a sufficient replication of the perfomance function cannot always be achieved. As with any other regression problem, the formation of a sufficiently good model cannot be taken for granted. While Grid Search ends with the evaluation of the model performance, Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation additionally calculates the Surrogate and Acquisition Function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point to consider is that Bayesian optimisation aims to sample hyperparameter combinations in a way that the uncertainty is reduced over time. This requires *systematic sampling*. As combinations are no-longer randomly sampled and the sampling relies on prior information, parallelisation becomes challening in this case. \n",
